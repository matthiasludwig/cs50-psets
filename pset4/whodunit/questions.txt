1.  stint.h includes several int data types to ensure compatibility across different systems.
    - It includes exact-width integer types with exact N bytes across all systems
    - Least-width integer types with at least N bytes across all systems
    - Fastes integer types with at least N bytes across all systems. It is the fastest implementation.
    - Maximum-width integer types which is guaranteed to be the biggest integer.
    - Pointer that can hold any type of
2.  It creates an unsigned int of exact 8, 16 and 32 bits. And an int of exact 16 bits.
3.  BYTE: 1 byte / 8 bits
    DWORD: 4 bytes / 32 bits
    LONG: 4 bytes / 32 bits
    WORD: 2 bytes / 16 bits
4.  The first two bytes of an bitmap are x424d (in ASCII 'BM')
5.  biSize includes the picture width and height with padding. the bfSize includes the BITMAPINFOHEADER and the BITMAPFILEHEADER (= total size of the file)
6.  That would indicate that the BMP is top-down. That the pixels start with the upper left corner and go to the bottom right corner
7.  biBitCount indicates the Bits per pixel
8.  The file could not exist (read), can not be created (write) and/or the permission to use the files is not given
9.  Because we read the bytes into our structs one by one
10. It results in a padding of 3
11. fseek checks the read in values for a specific value (here the padding)
12. SEEK_CUR means it is compared with the current location in the file. Opposite to SEEK_SET or SEEK_END with would search at the beginning/end of the file.
